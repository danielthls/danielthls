### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome, friends, enemies, and the undecided!   I'm known as Daniel Thomaz. I hail from Blumenau/Santa Catarina - Brazil, and I write Javascript and now Object Pascal. I am a lawyer who found rather late my passion for programming and developing, and now I look to switch careers.

Some examples of my code include <a href="https://github.com/danielthls/vcl-veterans">Eu Ajudo</a>. This is a Portuguese-language project that helps connect citizens with their local government. It allows citizens to report problems and organize voluntary work. It includes a backend as well as two frontend applications. One works on mobiles for the citizens. A second operates on desktop for the city administration. 

I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/danielthls/projetoNovaVisao">Nova VisÃ£o</a>, a simple Portuguese-language desktop application. It lets you send Dall-E a picture, generating variants sent to an email or phone. 

I am proud to have created <a href="https://github.com/danielthls/WoD-L5R-Dice">WoD-L5R Dice</a>, an English-language Discord bot that rolls dice for various RPG systems. It also keeps track of roleplay stats. 

I'm learning Java and I also dabble in HTML and CSS.  I enjoy beginning small projects and expanding upon them as time goes on. While seeking employment, I'm still improving my current projects and creating new ones!
